## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML

- This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.
- It uses [CSS pseudo attributes](https://github.com/tmobile/magentaA11y/blob/main/_sass/modules/_input-checkbox.scss) to create the checkbox indicator, no Javascript.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-checkbox.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-checkbox.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Don't put interactive elements inside the label

Even though this is valid HTML, it creates unpredictable results with screenreaders. A (currently) reliable method is to keep interactive elements outside the label and reference it with `aria-describedby="hint-id"`

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-legal.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-legal.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Disabled and focusable checkbox (preferred)

- An input using `aria-disabled="true` will be focusable with the tab key
- Use JS to preventDefault()

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-disabled-focusable.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-disabled-focusable.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Fully disabled checkbox

- An input using `disabled` will not be focusable with the tab key
- Arrow keys will still be able to browse disabled inputs

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-disabled.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-disabled.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### When you can't use semantic HTML

This custom checkbox requires extra attributes and event listeners.

{% highlight html %}
<div role="checkbox" tabindex="0" aria-checked="true">
  Alpha
</div>
{% endhighlight %}


### Speciality checkboxes

Sometimes a design may call for a card type checkbox. 
- Its core should still be a semantic checkbox input
- Use `aria-describedby` to read extra content _after_ the the name, role and state

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-card.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-checkbox-card.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

### Name
- `label` text must describe the checkbox input.
- Use `aria-describedby="hint-id"` for hints or additional descriptions
- `aria-label="Checkbox input purpose"` can also be used (as a last resort)

### Role
- **By default**, semantic HTML checkbox inputs identify as a checkbox
- Use `role="checkbox"` for custom elements

### Group
- Semantic HTML
    - `<fieldset>` wraps a checkbox group
    - `<legend>` describes the group's purpose
    - Each `<label>` must include `for="input-id"` to be associated with its input
- Custom elements
    - Use `role="group"` in the place of fieldset
    - Use `aria-labelledby="label-id"` to associate an element as a label
    - `aria-label="Group purpose"` can also be used if there's no label with an ID

### State
- Semantic HTML
    - Use `checked` for native HTML
    - Use the `disabled` state for inactive checkboxes
- Custom element
    - Use `aria-checked="true/false"` to express state
    - Use `aria-disabled="true"` to declare inactive elements

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
- Custom elements will require keyboard event listeners
