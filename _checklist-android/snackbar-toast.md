## Developer notes


- A snack bar or toast must not be timed to disappear.  
- An element to close it must be available.  
- A message that appears after the user has arrived on the screen must be announced dynamically, but focus shouldn't move to it.
- A message that is present when screen is launched must be in the swipe order for the screen reader user and tab order for the keyboard user.
- Push notifications that have a place where they are stored and users can access them at a later time, can be timed to disappear
